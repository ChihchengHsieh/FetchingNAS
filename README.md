# FetchingNAS
Use RL(ActorCritic) and Fetching method for Searching Neural Network Operations

FetchingNAS is different from other NAS models since itâ€™s not trying to create a graph. FetchingNAS is focusing on the operations and passing more right of control to the Agent. Therefore, the agent has the right to select the weights and the operation it wants.

#### Training on MNIST (for 70 epochs < Roughtly 6 hours on one GPU >):

### The results show they use the same weight repetitively
#### Best Dag
